## 🚀 Project Overview

The application contains **two buttons**, each performing a different calculation:

### 🔹 Button 1 – Rectangle Area Calculation
- Uses predefined short and long edge values.
- Calculates the area of a rectangle.
- Displays the result on a `Label`.

Formula used: Area = Short Edge × Long Edge

### 🔹 Button 2 – Exam Score Average Calculation
- Three exam scores are defined using `int` variables.
- The scores are summed.
- The average score is calculated and displayed.

Formula used: Average = (Score1 + Score2 + Score3) / 3
